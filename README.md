# Linux AMLogic Toolkit Custom Modded By Eliminater74

## I am not Original Author, I just updated where original Author Left off.

### Note: This README is outdated, This new package does alot more then what is listed here:

### I will update it when I have time.

Allows to unpack and repack AMLogic Android images on Linux systems without using the Customization Tool - works for Android 7.

# Features

- Unpack and repack any image
- Mount and edit `system` partition
- Unpack and repack `logo` partition (for bootup and upgrading logos)
- Unpack and repack `boot` image and `initrd` ramdisk
- Flash the image directly to a device without repacking it (faster than using the USB Burning Tool)
- Works for Android 7
- No need to unpack the image each time you want to use the tool

# What it cannot do (yet)

- Edit other partitions of the image such as `recovery` (you can still replace the `PARTITION` files by hand)

# Dependencies

- `zlib1g-dev` for `simg2img` and `img2simg`
- `libblkid-dev` for `abootimg` (unpacking and repacking boot image)
- the `i386` packages if needed (for the logo unpacking / repacking binary)

# How to use it

- Clone or download this repository
- Install the dependencies
- Move to the directory of the repository, and **stay there**
- _(first time, or after a cleanup)_ Run `./bin/build` to build the required tools
- _(when editing a new image file)_ Run `./bin/unpack input.img` to unpack `input.img`
- The result is :

  - `output/image` : raw image files (`PARTITION` files)
  - `output/system` : system partition files
  - `output/logo` : logo partition files
  - `output/boot` : boot partition files

- From now on you can edit the files of the `output` directory

  - Note that those files will be overwritten when repacking :

    - `output/image/system.PARTITION`
    - `output/image/boot.PARTITION`
    - `output/image/logo.PARTITION`
    - `output/boot/initrd.img` if using `./bin/extract_initrd`

  - If you happen to loose the `output/system` mounting point (after a reboot for instance), just run `./bin/remount` to mount it again
  - On the other hand, you can unmount the system partition using `./bin/unmount`
  - If you want to extract the `initrd` ramdisk, use the `./bin/extract_initrd` and `./bin/recreate_initrd` scripts (output in `output/initrd`)

- **Be careful :**

  - Don't break everything by chmod'ing the whole `output/system` folder, because it will be replicated in the image and it won't boot !
  - Don't rename the files in `output/boot.img`
  - If you extract and recreate the `initrd` ramdisk, its size will change and it will most likely break the boot image. To fix this, edit the `bootimg.cfg` file in `output/boot` to replicate the change in size (you can repack the image, let it fail and read the logs to see the new size).

- When you have finished editing the files, run `./bin/repack output.img` to repack the image to `output.img`
- Additionnaly, you can use `./bin/flash` to flash the image to a device through USB (you will need the udev rule, see <https://github.com/Stane1983/aml-linux-usb-burn>)

  - The device type (`gxl`) is hardcoded into the flashing script, edit it if you're not using S905, S905X or S919

- Done !

# Troubleshooting

- If you have a `file not found` error when trying to unpack and repack the logo partition, install the `i386` libraries by following the accepted answer of this post : <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/13391/getting-not-found-message-when-running-a-32-bit-binary-on-a-64-bit-system>
